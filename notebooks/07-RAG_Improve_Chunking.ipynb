      "Text\t Models Meta AI, formerly known as Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR), is an artificial intelligence laboratory that aims to share open-source frameworks, tools, libraries, and models for research exploration and large-scale production deployment. In 2018, they released the open-source PyText, a modeling framework focused on NLP systems. Then, in August 2022, they announced the release of BlenderBot 3, a chatbot designed to improve conversational skills and safety. In November 2022, Meta developed a large language model called Galactica, which assists scientists with tasks such as summarizing academic papers and annotating molecules and proteins. Released in February 2023, LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) is a transformer-based foundational large language model by Meta that ventures into both the AI and academic spaces. The model aims to help researchers, scientists, and engineers advance their work in exploring AI applications. It will be released under a non-commercial license to prevent misuse, and access will be granted to academic researchers, individuals, and organizations affiliated with the government, civil society, academia, and industry research facilities on a selective case-by-case basis. The sharing of codes and weights allows other researchers to test new approaches in LLMs. The LLaMA models have a range of 7 billion to 65 billion parameters. LLaMA-65B can be compared to DeepMind's Chinchilla and Google's PaLM. Publicly available unlabeled data was used to train these models, and training smaller foundational models require less computing power and resources. LLaMA 65B and 33B have been trained on 1.4 trillion tokens in 20 different languages, and according to the Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) team, the model's performance varies across languages. The data sources used for training included CCNet (67%), GitHub, Wikipedia, ArXiv, Stack Exchange, and books. LLaMA, like other large scale language models, has issues related to biased & toxic generation and hallucination.  6.

      "Text\t I. Llama 2: Revolutionizing Commercial Use Unlike its predecessor Llama 1, which was limited to research use, Llama 2 represents a major advancement as an open-source commercial model. Businesses can now integrate Llama 2 into products to create AI-powered applications. Availability on Azure and AWS facilitates fine-tuning and adoption. However, restrictions apply to prevent exploitation. Companies with over 700 million active daily users cannot use Llama 2. Additionally, its output cannot be used to improve other language models.  II. Llama 2 Model Flavors Llama 2 is available in four different model sizes: 7 billion, 13 billion, 34 billion, and 70 billion parameters. While 7B, 13B, and 70B have already been released, the 34B model is still awaited. The pretrained variant, trained on a whopping 2 trillion tokens, boasts a context window of 4096 tokens, twice the size of its predecessor Llama 1. Meta also released a Llama 2 fine-tuned model for chat applications that was trained on over 1 million human annotations. Such extensive training comes at a cost, with the 70B model taking a staggering 1720320 GPU hours to train. The context window's length determines the amount of content the model can process at once, making Llama 2 a powerful language model in terms of scale and efficiency.  III. Safety Considerations: A Top Priority for Meta Meta's commitment to safety and alignment shines through in Llama 2's design. The model demonstrates exceptionally low AI safety violation percentages, surpassing even ChatGPT in safety benchmarks. Finding the right balance between helpfulness and safety when optimizing a model poses significant challenges. While a highly helpful model may be capable of answering any question, including sensitive ones like \"How do I build a bomb?\", it also raises concerns about potential misuse. Thus, striking the perfect equilibrium between providing useful information and ensuring safety is paramount. However, prioritizing safety to an extreme extent can lead to a model that struggles to effectively address a diverse range of questions. This limitation could hinder the model's practical applicability and user experience. Thus, achieving\n",

Thus, striking the perfect equilibrium between providing useful information and ensuring safety is paramount. However, prioritizing safety to an extreme extent can lead to a model that struggles to effectively address a diverse range of questions. This limitation could hinder the model's practical applicability and user experience. Thus, achieving an optimum balance that allows the model to be both helpful and safe is of utmost importance. To strike the right balance between helpfulness and safety, Meta employed two reward models - one for helpfulness and another for safety - to optimize the model's responses. The 34B parameter model has reported higher safety violations than other variants, possibly contributing to the delay in its release.  IV. Helpfulness Comparison: Llama 2 Outperforms Competitors Llama 2 emerges as a strong contender in the open-source language model arena, outperforming its competitors in most categories. The 70B parameter model outperforms all other open-source models, while the 7B and 34B models outshine Falcon in all categories and MPT in all categories except coding. Despite being smaller, Llam a2's performance rivals that of Chat GPT 3.5, a significantly larger closed-source model. While GPT 4 and PalM-2-L, with their larger size, outperform Llama 2, this is expected due to their capacity for handling complex language tasks. Llama 2's impressive ability to compete with larger models highlights its efficiency and potential in the market. However, Llama 2 does face challenges in coding and math problems, where models like Chat GPT 4 excel, given their significantly larger size. Chat GPT 4 performed significantly better than Llama 2 for coding (HumanEval benchmark)and math problem tasks (GSM8k benchmark).

Open-source AI technologies, like Llama 2, continue to advance, offering strong competition to closed-source models.  V. Ghost Attention: Enhancing Conversational Continuity One unique feature in Llama 2 is Ghost Attention, which ensures continuity in conversations. This means that even after multiple interactions, the model remembers its initial instructions, ensuring more coherent and consistent responses throughout the conversation. This feature significantly enhances the user experience and makes Llama 2 a more reliable language model for interactive applications. In the example below, on the left, it forgets to use an emoji after a few conversations. On the right, with Ghost Attention, even after having many conversations, it will remember the context and continue to use emojis in its response.  VI. Temporal Capability: A Leap in Information Organization Meta reported a groundbreaking temporal capability, where the model organizes information based on time relevance. Each question posed to the model is associated with a date, and it responds accordingly by considering the event date before which the question becomes irrelevant. For example, if you ask the question, \"How long ago did Barack Obama become president?\", its only relevant after 2008. This temporal awareness allows Llama 2 to deliver more contextually accurate responses, enriching the user experience further.  VII. Open Questions and Future Outlook Meta's open-sourcing of Llama 2 represents a seismic shift, now offering developers and researchers commercial access to a leading language model. With Llama 2 outperforming MosaicML's current MPT models, all eyes are on how Databricks will respond. Can MosaicML's next MPT iteration beat Llama 2? Is it worthwhile to compete\n",

With QLoRA, only a fraction of the adapter weights are trained and summed with the existing frozen pre-trained weights of the model during inference. Here is an illustrative Colab notebook.

Since we use QLoRa we are effectively closely following this paper - QLORA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs concerning the training data set, the format that the authors used to train their Gauanco model This is the format for the Llama2 model and will be different for others. One of the hardest problems of training is finding or creating a good quality data set to train. In our case, converting the available training data set to the instruction data set. Since our use case is Closed Book QA, we need to convert this to a QA format. Using older NLP methods like NER (Named Entity Recognition) and then using that to create a QA dataset was not effective. This is where the Self-instruct concept could be used However previous to Llama2, the best-performing model was the GPT 3/4 model via ChatGPT or its API and using these models to do the same was expensive. The 7 billion model of Llama2 has sufficient NLU (Natural Language Understanding) to create output based on a particular format. Running this in 4-bit mode via Quantisation makes it feasible compute-wise to run this on a large data set and convert it to a QA dataset. This was the prompt used. The\n",

      "Text\t LLaMA: Meta's new AI tool According to the official release, LLaMA is a foundational language model developed to assist 'researchers and academics' in their work (as opposed to the average web user) to understand and study these NLP models. Leveraging AI in such a way could give researchers an edge in terms of time spent. You may not know this, but this would be Meta's third LLM after Blender Bot 3 and Galactica. However, the two LLMs were shut down soon, and Meta stopped their further development, as it produced erroneous results. Before moving further, it is important to emphasize that LLaMA is NOT a chatbot like ChatGPT. As I mentioned before, it is a 'research tool' for researchers. We can expect the initial versions of LLaMA to be a bit more technical and indirect to use as opposed to the case with ChatGPT, which was very direct, interactive, and a lot easy to use. \"Smaller, more performant models such as LLaMA enable ... research community who don't have access to large amounts of infrastructure to study these models.. further democratizing access in this important, fast-changing field,\" said Meta in its official blog. Meta's effort of \"democratizing\" access to the public could shed light on one of the critical issues of Generative AI - toxicity and bias. ChatGPT and other LLMs (obviously, I am referring to Bing) have a track record of responding in a way that is toxic and, well... evil. The Verge and major critics have covered it in much detail. Oh and the community did get the access, but not in the way Meta anticipated. On March 3rd, a downloadable torrent of the LLaMA system was posted on 4chan. 4chan is an anonymous online forum known for its controversial content and diverse range of discussions, which has nearly 222 million unique monthly visitors. LLaMA is currently not in use on any of Meta's products. But Meta has plans to make it available to researchers before they can use them in their own products. It's worth mentioning that Meta did not release\n",

The real magic of this is that a laptop with a sufficient recent GPU (having Tensor Cores), can run the 7 billion Lamma2 pre-trained model open-sourced recently by Meta Research. Imagine the compressed knowledge and an NLU (Natural Language Understanding) model running on your local laptop. This is still a smallish model, but it's still capable of understanding and has sufficient world knowledge embedded in it to be quite useful. Imagine what a model like this or better models in the future could do if it could run in small servers or in cars, and leverage its causal reasoning and world model knowledge to supervise lower-level/specialist AI/ML systems. So we have now a way to fit reasonably large models (7B or more) in a single GPU, via Quantisation and then train them in a parameter-efficient way via LoRa/QLoRa. Take 1: Un-supervised Training Fine-tuning with QLoRa Using the small training data and QLoRA, I first tried to train a large 7B Lamma2 model by feeding in the training text as is (Causal LM model training via UnSupervised learning).

Also, note that the generated QA missed transforming training data related to Professor Thiersch's method to a proper QA dataset. These and other improvements need to be experimented with, as well as to train with some completely new data that the model has not seen to test more effectively. Update: Training with new data was done by writing an imaginary story with ChatGPT help and then creating an instruction tuning data set (colab notebook). The model was then trained and tested (colab notebook) with this generated instruct dataset. The results confirm that the model learns via Instruct tuning, not only the fed questions but other details and relations of the domain. Problems with hallucinations remain (Bordor, Lila characters who are not in the story). The LLama2 13B 4-bit fine-tuned model has better output than the 7B model. A lot more needs to be explored in Fine-tuning. One observation is that slight changes in prompts give different answers. Since the output is not deterministic (that is, with even the same prompt, it varies over time), it is all the more difficult to fine-tune prompts to\n",
