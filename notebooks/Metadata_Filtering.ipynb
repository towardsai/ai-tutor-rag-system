Intuition for Evaluation:We evaluate the NER model based on Span-Identification and Span-Prediction.   Span-Identification:   https://cees-roele.medium.com/custom-evaluation-of-spans-in-spacy-f1f2e7a99ad8   As discussed  NER is a multiclass Classification problem with SHIFT  OUT  and REDUCE as output. But we evaluate our models only based on REDUCE.   The above picture shows how Precision  Recall  and F-Score are calculated.

If so  # our prediction is neither right nor wrong  we just # ignore it. if all(token.ent_iob != 0 for token in g_span): key = (pred_ent.label_  indices[0]  indices[-1] + 1) if key in golds: score_per_type[pred_ent.label_].tp += 1 golds.remove(key) else: score_per_type[pred_ent.label_].fp += 1 for label  start  end in golds: score_per_type[label].fn += 1 totals = PRFScore() for prf in score_per_type.values(): totals += prf if len(totals) > 0: return { ents_p: totals.precision  ents_r: totals.recall  ents_f: totals.fscore  ents_per_type: {k: v.to_dict() for k  v in score_per_type.items()}  } else: return { ents_p: None  ents_r: None  ents_f: None  ents_per_type: None  }Reference: https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/scorer.py#L760   Span Prediction :   There are 9 different entires like [RAM  STORAGE  BATTERY CAPACITY  PROCESSOR_TYPE  SCREEN_SIZE  REFRESH_RATE  SCREEN_TYPE  BACK_CAMERA  FRONT_CAMERA] to predict for REDUCE class.

There will be math and code  but it is written in a way that allows you to decide which are the fun parts.   A bit on the origins of the algorithm: It was proposed by Yoav Freund and Robert E. Schapire in a 1997 paper  A Decision-Theoretic Generalization of On-Line Learning and an Application to Boostinga beautiful and brilliant publication for an effective and useful algorithm.   Lets start with the pros  cons  and uses of AdaBoost.   Advantages: improves performance and achieves higher accuracy than a single model. It reduces overfitting compared to some other machine learning algorithms.   Disadvantages: AdaBoost can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers. It requires careful tuning  and the performance can depend on the choice of weak learners and the number of iterations. It cannot be parallelized (or only partially)  since each predictor can only be trained after the previous predictor has been trained and evaluated. As a result  it does not scale as well as bagging or pasting.   Applications: image recognition  text classification  fraud detection  predictive modeling.   Introduction  what is ensemble learning and boosting?Python script with an Ada Boost algorithm  lets go straight to using this toolAda Boost explanation  the math on how it worksAda Boost example  simplifying the math  an example of one iterationReferencesIntroductionLets talk a bit about the wisdom of the crowd. Wisdom of the crowd is a phenomenon that suggests that the collective judgment of a diverse number of people is often surprisingly accurate. This mainly occurs because of the central limit theorem  which states that when you take an average of a large number of independent observations  the distribution will center around the true value.   Lets explain this with an example. What if there was a competition where people had to guess how many bubble gum pieces were in a jar? Thousands of different (independent) people will guess; some might be close  and others will be quite far from the true number  but once we calculate the average of the guesses  we will be quite close to the actual number of bubble gum balls  this my friends is the wisdom of the crowd.   How does this apply to Machine Learning?   If we have many predictors (decision trees  other classifiers or regressors) and we aggregate the predictions of this group  they will often perform better than the best individual predictor. A group of predictors is called an ensemble  thus  this technique is called Ensemble Learning.   AdaBoost belongs to a method called boosting. Boosting refers to any ensemble method that combines several weak learners (simple models) into a strong learner (a more accurate model).   There are many boosting methods  the most popular by far are Ada Boosting and Gradient Boosting.   Ada Boost with Python and Scikit-LearnPart 1: data preparationWe create a dummy dataset and separate the data into train and test.   import numpy as np from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split # Generate a random dataset (for example purposes) X  y = make_classification(n_samples=100  n_features=2  n_informative=2  n_redundant=0  random_state=42) # Split the dataset into training and testing sets X_train  X_test  y_train  y_test = train_test_split(X  y  test_size=0.3  random_state=42)Part 2: AdaBoost with Decision Trees (1 branch)First  lets understand the possible parameters in Scikit-learns AdaBoostClassifier:   estimator: The base estimator from which the boosted ensemble is built.

AdaBoost  short for Adaptive Boosting  is a machine learning algorithm that is used to improve the performance of other machine learning algorithms. We will define a few key concepts to explain how it works:   Weak Learners: models that perform slightly better than random guessing. Decision trees with one split are often used.Boosting: the process of combining multiple weak learners to form a strong learner. Each learner has a weight based on the performance of the previous learners.Weight Adjustment: First  all data points have equal weights. After each iteration  the weight of incorrectly classified points is increased; that way  the learner focuses more on the difficult cases.Combining Learners: the final model is a weighted sum of all the weak learners; each learners contribution to the final model is based on its accuracy  and more accurate learners are given higher weights.Algorithm stepsThe image shows how the algorithm improves on each iteration on separating between the blue and red dots. Lets find out how each step works.   Initialize Weights:Assign equal weights to all data points (each predictor).2. Train Weak Learner and Calculate Weighted Error   Train a weak learner on the weighted dataset (h_t).Calculate the error rate of the weak learner.3. Calculate Alpha  the learner's weight   4. Update weights   5. Combine weak learners   Example of one iterationInitialize weights   Train Weak Learner and Calculate Weighted Error   Calculate Alpha   Update weights   This process continues for each iteration.

Systems like Self-Reflective RAG (Self-RAG) and Corrective RAG (CRAG) are examples of these advancements. \\n\\nSelf-RAG introduces self-reflection tags that help the language model assess the relevance of retrieved documents dynamically, allowing it to critique the context before generating responses. On the other hand, CRAG employs an external evaluator to refine the quality of retrieved documents, ensuring that only the most relevant and high-quality context is used for generation.\\n\\nMoreover, Speculative RAG further optimizes the RAG process by decomposing tasks into drafting and verification phases. A specialized RAG drafter is used to generate multiple drafts based on subsets of retrieved documents, which are then verified by a larger generalist language model. This method minimizes redundancy and accelerates the generation process, leading to significant improvements in accuracy and reduced latency.\\n\\nOverall, these advanced RAG systems leverage sophisticated strategies to enhance contextual relevance, generate diverse answer candidates, and improve the overall quality and efficiency of responses generated from external knowledge sources.'"

Additionally, prompt tuning is another technique where specific prompts guide the model's outputs without modifying the model itself.\\n\\nPEFT is advantageous, particularly for large models with billions of parameters, as it reduces both the computational burden and the risk of catastrophic forgetting, a challenge associated with full fine-tuning where the model may lose its original knowledge when trained on new tasks.\""

      "Text\t SAMSUM is one of the datasets that FLAN T5 uses. There are several pre-trained FLAN T5 models that have been fine-tuned on SAMSUM  including Phil Schmid/flan-t5-base-samsum and jasonmcaffee/flan-t5-large-samsum on Hugging Face. If we want to fine-tune the FLAN T5 model specifically for formal dialogue conversations  we can do so using the DIALOGUESUM dataset.   Models fine-tuned on DialogSum can be applied to areas like customer support  meeting minutes generation  chatbot summarization  and more.   2. PEFT (Parameter efficient fine tuning)Training LLMs is computationally intensive. Full finetuning is computationally expensive as it might change each weight in the model. First  we start with a pretrained LLM like GPT-3. This model already has a vast amount of knowledge and understanding of language. Then we provide task-specific datasets  which could be data for question answering or sentiment analysis or any other customer dataset. During training  full finetuning process makes slight adjustments to every weight in the pretrained model. While the model weights are substantial  we have other important aspects during training like Optimizer  which adds up to the cost. For example  Optimizer States  gradients  forward activation  and temporary memory. These additional components add up to the training cost.   Three main approaches are used in PEFT: Selective / reparameterization/additive.   1. SelectiveHere  we select a subset of initial LLM parameters to fine-tune.   2. ReparameterizationWe reparameterize model weights using a low-rank representation. We will discuss LoRA in detail below.   LORA: Low Rank Representation:   Each layer in a transformer architecture has multiple weight matrices for different operations  like self-attention or feed-forward networks. These matrices can have different sizes depending on the specific layer and configuration. Let us take an example by picking a matrix of size 512 x 64 = 32 768 parameters. Let us now see LoRA with rank = 8.   Original Weight Matrix: Dimensions: 512 x 64  Parameters: 32 768 (512 x 64)Matrix A (Rank Decomposition):\n",

      "Text\t 32 768 parameters (512 x 64)Total LORA Parameters: 4 608 parameters (512 + 4 096)3. AdditiveWe add trainable layers or parameters to the model in the form of adapter modules.   The two main additive approaches are:   Adapter Modules: These are small  trainable neural network modules strategically inserted into specific layers of the pre-trained LLM. They help the LLM learn task-specific information without drastically changing its underlying knowledge.Prompt Tuning: This approach doesnt involve adding any new modules to the model itself. Instead  it focuses on crafting specific prompts (essentially instructions or questions) that guide the pre-trained LLM toward the desired task.All these approaches are similar to transfer learning  but they are more efficient in that they only fine-tune a subset of parameters rather than fine-tuning the complete layer. Even adapter modules are lightweight.   PEFT is particularly beneficial when dealing with large LLMs that have billions or even trillions of parameters  as fine-tuning all of them can be computationally expensive and resource-intensive.   PEFT is less prone to the catastrophic forgetting problems of full fine-tuning. Full fine-tuning results in a new version of the model for every task you train on.   Metrics to assess the performanceIn the language model  evaluation is more challenging since the output is non deterministic.   Let us explore some of the metrics that we can use to evaluate.   ROUGE-1: (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)ROUGE-1 is recall oriented metric  which means it prioritizes identifying how many of the important words from the reference summaries are included in the generated summary. ROUGE 1 focuses on individual words(unigrams). Similarly  ROUGE-2 focuses on bigrams and so goes on.   Let us take an example of ROUGE-1:   Lets walk through an example step-by-step:   Reference Text: Mike really loves drinking tea.Generated Text: Mike adores sipping tea.Step 1: Identify Unigrams   Reference Text Unigrams: {Mike  really  loves  drinking  tea}Generated Text Unigrams: {Mike  adores  sipping  tea}Step 2: Count Overlapping Unigrams   Overlapping Unigrams: {Mike\n",

      "Text\t U+1F9E0. This article introduced the transformer architecture to NLP.   This architecture was what we needed to lead us to large language models  but it also solved the problem we discussed earlier: Contextualized Word Embeddings!   How?The transformer architecture was originally designed for translation  like French to English. So  it makes sense that it only had two components:   The EncoderThe DecoderThe input to the encoder would be a sequence of words or tokens  and the output would be a sequence of continuous representations. Then  the output of the decoder  which would decode  was again words or tokens.   How would the translation work?The encoder would take in a phrase in one language and produce output vectors representing the meaning of the input phrase. To produce these vectors  the encoder could attend to tokens to the left or right of any given token.   On the other hand  the decoder operates one token at a time and considers the predicted tokens along with the encoders outputs.   Hence  the decoder predicts the first word: I.   This is again fed around to the input. Now  the decoder considers the encoder input and the previously generated token and predicts am and so on  one token at a time.   Reread it:   The encoder attends to tokens to the left and right of its output  resulting in encoder output vectors being the contextualized vectors were looking for.   But  the decoder only attends to the inputs to the left.         Is translation the only thing we use this for?Transformers with attention are used for more than simple translation tasks. The most famous ones are the LLMs  like GPT-2  GPT-3  and GPT-4  which were decoder-only architectures. Another well-known example is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)  an encoder-only transformer mode used as a component in sentence embedding models.

Faster Inference Times:   By reducing the number of parameters and optimizing layer structures  these models can achieve faster inference times  which is critical for real-time applications.3. Lower Memory Footprint:   Efficient models require less memory  enabling their deployment in environments where memory is a limiting factor  such as embedded systems and edge devices.4. Energy Efficiency:   With reduced computational complexity and memory requirements  efficient architectures consume less power  which is essential for battery-operated devices and large-scale deployment in data centers aiming to reduce energy costs.Notable Efficient ArchitecturesMobileBERT:Design: MobileBERT is a compact version of BERT designed specifically for mobile devices. It employs a bottleneck structure to reduce parameter count and computational cost while maintaining high accuracy.Performance: MobileBERT offers performance close to that of BERT with significantly reduced latency and memory usage.2. TinyBERT:   Design: TinyBERT is a smaller  faster version of BERT created using knowledge distillation and other model compression techniques. It maintains the essential features of BERT while being more resource-efficient.Performance: TinyBERT achieves a similar level of accuracy to BERT but with a much smaller model size and faster inference times.3. DistilBERT:   Design: DistilBERT is another compact version of BERT that uses knowledge distillation to reduce the number of layers by half while preserving about 97% of BERTs performance.Performance: DistilBERT runs approximately 60% faster and uses 40% less memory than BERT  making it suitable for resource-constrained applications.Challenges and ConsiderationsBalancing Performance and Efficiency:Designing efficient architectures requires careful balancing of model complexity and performance.
