      "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid approach that augments a generative large language model with retrieved external knowledge to improve factuality, currency, and domain-specific accuracy. The process has two main interacting components—Retrieval and Generation—and typically follows several ordered processing steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Query classification\n",
      "   - Decide whether the input/query requires retrieval (e.g., is external knowledge needed) or can be handled directly by the LLM.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Retrieval (Indexing and Searching)\n",
      "   - Index external documents for efficient access (sparse inverted indexes or dense vector encodings).\n",
      "   - Search the index to fetch documents or document chunks relevant to the query.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Reranking\n",
      "   - Optionally re-order the retrieved results using a reranker to prioritize the most relevant evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Repacking (Organization)\n",
      "   - Organize and assemble the selected retrieved materials into a structured context (e.g., concatenating, chunking or otherwise packaging documents) suitable for the generator.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Summarization (Condensing)\n",
      "   - Extract or compress key information from the repacked content to reduce redundancy and present salient facts to the generator.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Generation (Prompting and Inference)\n",
      "   - Provide the LLM with the query plus the prepared retrieved context and use prompting strategies (e.g., Chain of Thought, Tree of Thought, rephrase-and-respond) to guide reasoning and produce the final response.\n",
      "   - The LLM integrates the retrieved evidence during inference without needing further finetuning of model weights.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Post-processing (optional)\n",
      "   - Format outputs or extract structured items (e.g., entities, classifications) for downstream tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key implementation choices that affect RAG performance include how documents are split into chunks, what type of embeddings are used for semantic representation, and whether retrieval is performed adaptively per turn (gating) to avoid unnecessary retrievals. RAG enables rapid domain-specific deployment by updating or supplying relevant documents rather than retraining the LLM.\n"

      "Text\t Generative large language models are prone to producing outdated information or fabricating facts, although they were aligned with human preferences by reinforcement learning [1] or lightweight alternatives [2–5]. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques address these issues by combining the strengths of pretraining and retrieval-based models, thereby providing a robust framework for enhancing model performance [6]. Furthermore, RAG enables rapid deployment of applications for specific organizations and domains without necessitating updates to the model parameters, as long as query-related documents are provided. Many RAG approaches have been proposed to enhance large language models (LLMs) through query-dependent retrievals [6–8]. A typical RAG workflow usually contains multiple intervening processing steps: query classification (determining whether retrieval is necessary for a given input query), retrieval (efficiently obtaining relevant documents for the query), reranking (refining the order of retrieved documents based on their relevance to the query), repacking (organizing the retrieved documents into a structured one for better generation), summarization (extracting key information for response generation from the repacked document and eliminating redundancies) and models. Implementing RAG also requires decisions on the ways to properly split documents into chunks, the types of embeddings to use for semantically representing these chunks, the choice of\n",

      "Text\t Authors: Hao Yu, Aoran Gan, Kai Zhang, Shiwei Tong, Qi Liu, and Zhaofeng Liu.Numerous studies of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged from various perspectives since the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). The RAG system comprises two primary components: Retrieval and Generation. The retrieval component aims to extract relevant information from various external knowledge sources. It involves two main phases, indexing and searching. Indexing organizes documents to facilitate efficient retrieval, using either inverted indexes for sparse retrieval or dense vector encoding for dense retrieval. The searching component utilizes these indexes to fetch relevant documents based on the user's query, often incorporating the optional rerankers to refine the ranking of the retrieved documents. The generation component utilizes the retrieved content and question query to formulate coherent and contextually relevant responses with the prompting and inferencing phases. As the \"Emerging\" ability of LLMs and the breakthrough in aligning human commands, LLMs are the best performance choices model for the generation stage. Prompting methods like Chain of Thought, Tree of Thought, Rephrase and Respond guide better generation results. In the inferencing step, LLMs interpret the prompted input to generate accurate and in-depth responses that align with the query's intent and integrate the extracted information without further finetuning, such as fully finetuning or LoRA. Appendix A details the complete RAG structure. Figure 1 illustrates the structure of the RAG systems as mentioned.\n",

      "Text\t Despite the success of integrating large language models into the development of conversational systems, many studies have shown the effectiveness of retrieving and augmenting external knowledge for informative responses. Hence, many existing studies commonly assume the always need for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in a conversational system without explicit control. This raises a research question about such a necessity. In this study, we propose to investigate the need for each turn of system response to be augmented with external knowledge. In particular, by leveraging human judgements on the binary choice of adaptive augmentation, we develop RAGate, a gating model, which models conversation context and relevant inputs to predict if a conversational system requires RAG for improved responses. We conduct extensive experiments on devising and applying RAGate to conversational models and well-rounded analyses of different conversational scenarios. Our experimental results and analysis indicate the effective application of RAGate in RAG-based conversational systems in identifying system responses for appropriate RAG with high-quality responses and a high generation confidence. This study also identifies the correlation between the generation’s confidence level and the relevance of the augmented knowledge.\n",

      "- Effect: Greatly reduces number of trainable parameters. The rank controls the trade-off between parameter savings and approximation fidelity (lower rank → fewer parameters but possibly less precise adaptation).\n",

      "Text\t # FourierFT: Discrete Fourier Transformation Fine-Tuning[FourierFT](https://huggingface.co/papers/2405.03003) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that leverages Discrete Fourier Transform to compress the model's tunable weights. This method outperforms LoRA in the GLUE benchmark and common ViT classification tasks using much less parameters.FourierFT currently has the following constraints:- Only `nn.Linear` layers are supported.- Quantized layers are not supported.If these constraints don't work for your use case, consider other methods instead.The abstract from the paper is:> Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has recently gained much interest in fine-tuning foundation models. It effectively reduces the number of trainable parameters by incorporating low-rank matrices A and B to represent the weight change, i.e., Delta W=BA. Despite LoRA's progress, it faces storage challenges when handling extensive customization adaptations or larger base models. In this work, we aim to further compress trainable parameters by enjoying the powerful expressiveness of the Fourier transform. Specifically, we introduce FourierFT, which treats Delta W as a matrix in the spatial domain and learns only a small fraction of its spectral coefficients. With the trained spectral coefficients, we implement the inverse discrete Fourier transform to recover Delta W. Empirically, our FourierFT method shows comparable or better performance with fewer parameters than LoRA on various tasks, including natural language understanding, natural language generation, instruction tuning, and image classification. For example, when performing instruction tuning on the LLaMA2-7B model, FourierFT surpasses LoRA with only 0.064M trainable parameters, compared to LoRA's 33.5M.## FourierFTConfig[[autodoc]] tuners.fourierft.config.FourierFTConfig## FourierFTModel[[autodoc]] tuners.fourierft.model.FourierFTModel\n",

      "Text\t SAMSUM is one of the datasets that FLAN T5 uses. There are several pre-trained FLAN T5 models that have been fine-tuned on SAMSUM  including Phil Schmid/flan-t5-base-samsum and jasonmcaffee/flan-t5-large-samsum on Hugging Face. If we want to fine-tune the FLAN T5 model specifically for formal dialogue conversations  we can do so using the DIALOGUESUM dataset.   Models fine-tuned on DialogSum can be applied to areas like customer support  meeting minutes generation  chatbot summarization  and more.   2. PEFT (Parameter efficient fine tuning)Training LLMs is computationally intensive. Full finetuning is computationally expensive as it might change each weight in the model. First  we start with a pretrained LLM like GPT-3. This model already has a vast amount of knowledge and understanding of language. Then we provide task-specific datasets  which could be data for question answering or sentiment analysis or any other customer dataset. During training  full finetuning process makes slight adjustments to every weight in the pretrained model. While the model weights are substantial  we have other important aspects during training like Optimizer  which adds up to the cost. For example  Optimizer States  gradients  forward activation  and temporary memory. These additional components add up to the training cost.   Three main approaches are used in PEFT: Selective / reparameterization/additive.   1. SelectiveHere  we select a subset of initial LLM parameters to fine-tune.   2. ReparameterizationWe reparameterize model weights using a low-rank representation. We will discuss LoRA in detail below.   LORA: Low Rank Representation:   Each layer in a transformer architecture has multiple weight matrices for different operations  like self-attention or feed-forward networks. These matrices can have different sizes depending on the specific layer and configuration. Let us take an example by picking a matrix of size 512 x 64 = 32 768 parameters. Let us now see LoRA with rank = 8.   Original Weight Matrix: Dimensions: 512 x 64  Parameters: 32 768 (512 x 64)Matrix A (Rank Decomposition):\n",

A lower rank leads to fewer parameters but might result in a slightly less accurate approximation.We can also create task-specific decomposition matrices.In the example we discussed  LORA achieves a reduction of approximately 86% in the number of trainable parameters needed for fine-tuning. Heres the summary.   Original Weight Matrix: 32 768 parameters (512 x 64)Total LORA Parameters: 4 608 parameters (512 + 4 096)3. AdditiveWe add trainable layers or parameters to the model in the form of adapter modules.   The two main additive approaches are:   Adapter Modules: These are small  trainable neural network modules strategically inserted into specific layers of the pre-trained LLM. They help the LLM learn task-specific information without drastically changing its underlying knowledge.Prompt Tuning: This approach doesnt involve adding any new modules to the model itself. Instead  it focuses on crafting specific prompts (essentially\n",

      "2) Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\n",
      "- What: Replace full weight updates with low-rank matrices (W_delta = A·B) on selected projection matrices (often attention Q/K/V/O or MLPs); base W is frozen.\n",
      "- Pros: Very parameter-efficient; simple; negligible inference overhead if merged into base weights; widely used.\n",
      "- Cons: Performance sensitive to rank choice and which layers are targeted; merging requires care in deployment.\n",

      "- What: Learn continuous “soft prompt” vectors or virtual tokens prepended to inputs; model weights remain frozen.\n",
      "- Pros: Extremely parameter-efficient; fast to train; easy to swap per task.\n",

      "- Optimization: Use higher learning rates for PEFT params than full fine-tuning; Adam/AdamW are common; apply gradient clipping and weight decay as needed.\n",
      "- Early evaluation: Monitor for instability, hallucinations, or degeneration; small batches are common due to low param count.\n",
      "- Deployment: Many PEFT methods allow merging trained deltas into base weights to eliminate runtime overhead; otherwise, keep side modules and swap per task.\n",
