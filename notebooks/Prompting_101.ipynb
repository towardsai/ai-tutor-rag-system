            "### 1. **Pre-trained Models**\n",
            "   - **Transformers**: Use pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, or T5, which are available through libraries like Hugging Face's Transformers. These models can be fine-tuned for summarization tasks.\n",

            "     ```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. **Extractive Summarization**\n",
            "   - This method involves selecting key sentences or phrases from the original text. Libraries like `Sumy` or `Gensim` can help with this.\n",
            "   - **Example with Gensim**:\n",
            "     ```python\n",
            "     from gensim.summarization import summarize\n",
            "\n",

            "     print(summary)\n",
            "     ```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. **Abstractive Summarization**\n",
            "   - This method generates new sentences that capture the essence of the original text. Models like GPT-3 or T5 can be used for this purpose.\n",
            "   - You can access these models via APIs (like OpenAI's API for GPT-3) or use local implementations.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. **Online Tools and APIs**\n",
            "   - There are several online tools and APIs that provide summarization services. Some popular ones include:\n",
            "     - **OpenAI's GPT-3**: You can use the API to generate summaries.\n",
            "     - **SMMRY**: A web-based tool that summarizes text.\n",
            "     - **Resoomer**: Another online summarization tool.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 5. **Custom Implementation**\n",
            "   - If you have specific requirements, you can build a custom summarization model using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. This involves training a model on a dataset of documents and their summaries.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 6. **Evaluation**\n",
            "   - After generating summaries, it's important to evaluate their quality. You can use metrics like ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) to assess the performance of your summarization model.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 7. **Considerations**\n",
            "   - **Input Length**: Be mindful of the input length limitations of the models you use.\n",
            "   - **Context**: Ensure that the summarization captures the main ideas and context of the original text.\n",
            "   - **Fine-tuning**: For better results, consider fine-tuning models on domain-specific data.\n",

            "\n",
            "### 1. Access the Google Gemini Model\n",
            "- **API Access**: If Google Gemini is available via an API, you will need to sign up for access. Check Google Cloud or the specific platform where Gemini is hosted.\n",
            "- **Local Deployment**: If you have the model available for local use, ensure you have the necessary environment set up (e.g., Python, TensorFlow, or PyTorch).\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Prepare Your Documents\n",
            "- **Format**: Ensure your documents are in a compatible format (e.g., plain text, JSON, etc.).\n",
            "- **Preprocessing**: Clean the text by removing unnecessary elements (like headers, footers, or irrelevant sections) to improve summarization quality.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. Chunking (if necessary)\n",
            "- If your documents are lengthy, consider breaking them into smaller chunks. This can help the model process the information more effectively, as many models have input size limitations.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. Summarization Process\n",
            "- **Input Preparation**: Format your input according to the requirements of the Gemini model. This may involve creating a single input string that concatenates the text of all documents or processing them individually.\n",
            "- **Model Invocation**: Use the API or local model to generate summaries. If using an API, you might send a POST request with your documents as input.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 5. Post-Processing\n",
            "- **Combine Summaries**: If you summarized each document individually, you might want to combine these summaries into a cohesive overview.\n",
            "- **Refinement**: You can manually edit the summaries for clarity and coherence.\n",
            "\n",
