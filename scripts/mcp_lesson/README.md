# üåê MCP Lesson Python Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts developed as part of lessons on the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** ‚Äî an open standard introduced by Anthropic to standardize how AI applications connect with external tools, data sources, and systems.  
MCP enables seamless integration between large language models (LLMs) and various services, facilitating more efficient and secure AI workflows.

## Scripts

### 1. Weather Server
A Python-based server that provides weather information.  
This script is designed to expose data through an MCP-compatible interface.

### 2. Weather Client with OpenAI
An MCP client script that connects to the Weather Server and uses **OpenAI's** language models to interpret and enhance the weather data.

### 3. Weather Client with Claude
A variant of the client script that integrates with **Anthropic's Claude** model, showcasing interoperability using the MCP framework.

These scripts illustrate how MCP facilitates secure, standardized communication between AI models and external services ‚Äî ideal for developing modular, interoperable AI applications.
